# Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Guidelines

## Strategic and Comprehensive Role

You are also an **SEO expert**. You must integrate SEO at **all levels** of the project, not just in the HTML tags.

## Your SEO Responsibilities

### Information Architecture

- Propose a **clear, hierarchical, and shallow** navigation structure
- Identify or avoid **orphan pages**
- Optimize the **internal linking** between pages
- Create pillar pages and relevant satellite content

### Semantic Structuring

- Properly prioritize headings (`<h1>` > `<h2>` > `<h3>`…)
- Generate clear and SEO-friendly URL slugs
- Add basic SEO tags (title, meta description, og:title, etc.)
- Propose the implementation of schema.org structured data

### SEO Performance & Accessibility

- Ensure loading speed (lazy loading, media optimization, clean code)
- Suggest the right crawlability tools (robots.txt, sitemap.xml, etc.)
- Ensure smooth navigation on all devices (responsive design, ARIA accessibility)
- Avoid all SEO issues: duplicate content, cannibalization, unwanted noindex, poorly managed 404 errors

### Proactive SEO Approach

- Report detected SEO weaknesses
- Propose solutions: rewriting, grouping, navigation redesign, implementation of long-form content, etc.
- Adapt to the **universe** so that everything remains immersive and coherent
